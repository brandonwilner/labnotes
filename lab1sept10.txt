The terminal\
Why the teminal?\
Larger computers in the 70s\
shared computing environment'97machine servicing dozens, hundreds\
a terminal is not a given (thermostat)\
\
Most computers today are used by one person, though they have accounts
to accomodate a shared style\
\
Cloud computing is a return to the shared model. Logging into large
mainframes that services millions\

 \b0 Unix and its derivatives\
philosophy of computing that has found its way into almost every
computer that surrounds us today\
It'92s been around since the 80s and will be there for another century
at least\
Very stable, way to interact with machines that has been developed for a
long time and will continue to be\
'93Will this be around for a long time?'94 '93Will it grow?'94 '93Will
you be able to modify it?'94 '93Is the source code for a program
free?'94 '93Who controls it?'94 Is it proprietary?'94 '93Does it store
info in a proprietary environment or in plaintext?'94\
With Unix, plaintext is baked into the system.\
Creators of Unix wanted to create programs that operate in plaintext.\
It'92s a textual system where on a low level, the idea of producing,
processing text is baked into the philosophy. (Not some notion of
digital binary or code that drives it.)\
Reasons for Unix\
It'92s everywhere.\
It'92s long lasting.\
It'92s human friendly.\
\
 \b Interface \b0\
MS Word and Photoshop aren'92t compatible in terms of interface. They
each have a different language. In the terminal window, everything works
the same across machines. Standardization of interface. Small tools.\
It'92s a fairly friendly UI\
\
When you look for new tools, consider whether it'92ll grow with you.
What'92s the learning curve? Will it grow as your knowledge does? MS
Word is not targeted for advanced users. Writing books is difficult in
it. It'92s not designed for professional use.\
\
Tools that are the GPS'97where am I?\

Unix is a very simple language, vocabulary.\
Unix syntax:\
Verb \> adverb \> object\
Verb\
\
 \b ls \b0 has an implicit object (current directory)\
 \b ls bin \b0 lists contents of the directory bin\
EVERYTHING IS A PATH\
\
\
 \b pwd \b0 '96 means root (path to working directory)\
 \b ls \b0 '96 list\
(Files arranged in tree-like directory that starts at the root.)\
ls and pwd are your '93best friends.'94\
 \b man \b0 - manual\
 \b man ls \b0 '96 tells what ls stands for\
'93man is your best friend'94\
 \b man man \b0 used to be a book\
 \b clear \b0 '96 clears prompt\
 \b cd \b0 '96 change directory\
 \b .. \b0 means one directory up\
 \b '85 \b0 is two directories up\
 \b cd - \b0 goes to the last directory where you were\
 \b pushd \b0 '96 running list of directories\
 \b popd \b0 '96\
 \b / \b0 means root\
 \b bin, dev, boot, lib \b0 '96 tells developers what to name folders.
Advises where to install directories (for spec. users etc.).\
 \b \~ \b0 '96 home, it'92s a default. It'92s an arbitrary path.\
 \b cd \~ \b0 gets you to the home directory, whatever it is.\
 \b . \b0 '96 '93here.'94\
 \b mkdir \b0 '96 make directory (creates folder, file, etc.)\
 \b cat \b0 '96 concatenate files and print on the standard output
(screen, in my case).\

\
There are very powerful tools that do what spotlight does (find a
certain file), but you can make really complicated things like full text
search. Say you want to full text search your PDFs. Do PDFs contain
plaintext data?\
\
Unix has a bias towards plaintext data. It'92s portable, works on any
machine. Plaintext data is sustainable. If you are keeping documents in
plain data, it can be incorporated anywhere (a library, say). MS Word
files are not plaintext. Under the covers of something like a PDF file,
there'92s something that'92s not human readable. Adobe'92s code isn'92t
human readable. Need to think about the format in which we'92re storing
information. MS Word may not survive; it may choose to not maintain the
format in which we'92re writing.\
\
Librarians take long views of these matters; we don'92t always do so.
'93Will this be around for a long time?'94\
\
Plaintext is very easy to reprocess, to mine for info, to do a full-text
search. If you want to work programmatically, Adobe doesn'92t allow you
to do that. Adobe files are encrypted so that they'92re not accessible
through the back end. Encryption restricts low-level system access to
files. As researchers, DT hopes the govt. releases documents that are
easy to mine for info.\
\
Take a theoretical insight, see how it works on a system level.\
Tab is autocomplete. Protects you from doing stupid things.\
You may make a typo if you'92re typing, but autocomplete keeps it'92s
straight.\
If autocomplete isn'92t working, that may mean something is wrong in
your programming.\
.txt is plaintext. .doc is not.\
