\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hands-on feel for textuality.\
We'92ll return to Sontag. Talk about form and content.\
\
These technological decisions have a political implication.
Phenomenological implications as well (Heidegger).\
Technology as a way to form the world around us.\
Computer is not just an extension of one'92s hand, but one'92s brain.\
\
TEXT: how they work in our daily lives.\
Managerial problem: how do we organize our files? It has wider
implications'97they way we organize our files is related to the way
they'92re consumed, published, etc. ('93superstructural phenomena'94:
dissemination of knowledge).\
\
Superstructural problems have their roots in the base phenomena'97the
production of knowledge.\
\
THE PROBLEM: Text, documents'97we usually think of it as a finished
object. We think of them as points. We should start thinking about them
as lines or vectors. The vector from one brain to another brain. The
document is not just one thing. It travels: in space, literally, as well
as in time. Electrons travel across the country as do books in a truck.\
\
In textual criticism, it'92s very difficult to know when the poem is
finished. A fixed entity like a poem is actually an amorphous one. What
is the content of the poem; it'92s something shifting.\
\
An \b email \b0 : it'92s a vector and has physical shape.\
A \b term paper \b0 also has a particular vector.\
The vector of Google has a particular set of affordances: it will not
forget (for now).\
 \b Books on Amazon \b0\
same problems: how are they stored, shared, backed up.\
\
Encryption is an issue: you might do it yourself to allow it some amount
of encryption.Vectors push us in different directions and it'92s very
difficult to take control of them. Google, Amazon wants to say they'92ll
just take care of it for us.\
\
In the birth of an idea, we often use a proprietary format. Drafting in
Word pushes you into a particular ecosystem. If you want to enrypt a
document, you might not have the ability. The medium in which you start
will form the shape that idea takes.\
\
Solution: take the origin points of all of these vectors (book, to-do
list, email, document) and\
Common set of problems.\
Access, search, distribution, encryption, back-up'97what Google wants to
take of all of it for us. This is an uncomfortable idea (for Tenen, for
Heidegger).\
Extricate us from a particular set of vectors.\
 \b Turing. '93The Universal Machine'94 \b0\
Computer: a machine that can emulate any other machine. Turing'92s
definition.\
There'92s a level of abstraction that floats above the hardware, and
that'92s where we start.\
Frees of from the physical confines of the universe.\
Evan Moaklin: if you don'92t own the hardware, you don'92t own the
ideas.\
These things are not easy to do. It requires great training and
education. We don'92t normally examine the material contents of our
computers in this way.\
\
The idea is that you can unify the vectors. You can'92t search your
e-books and papers on your machine at the same time, but this is the
idea.\
The dream is to unify the vectors at the points of origin. And to do so
in plaintext'97non-proprietary, easy to search, easy to vectorize
(publish, disseminate).\
\
Winner paraphrased: when you buy into a technology, it'92s equivalent to
making the law.\
Most journals don'92t accept articles in anything but MS Word format.\
\
The text is relatively accessible. The materials (precious metals in a
computer, for instance) are not.\
\
Plaintext is the most accessible, malleable, searchable.\
Encryption is in an Espionage act. Weapons and encryption are military
technology. It'92s somebody writing something and wanting to submit it
through a secure channel.\
\
Minimal computer'97in places where service is not guaranteed or as fast.
If you want to be able to reach an African public, you'92ll have to
write in a different format'97something other than PDF. Instead of
documents being born as Word docs, we'92ll be able to start them as
plaintext. A movement to Word might be an act of publication.\
\
Form and content separated, gives you certain freedoms and affordances.\
MS Word: the form and content are not separate. Writing and formatting
happen simultaneously.\
When italicizing a word, there is mark-up underneath. The formatting has
to be embedded in a layer under your content. In a perverse way, what
you see isn'92t what you get. That formatting layer is proprietary. The
thing that will recreate that layer is either your printer or MS Word.
Nothing else will italicize for you.\
\
Typesetting is a huge exporting market, mostly in India. Smart thing to
do would be to \b separate \b0 the content from the formatting. We'92re
surrounded by devices that will format text differently. Why are we so
concerned about formatting? It frees you a little bit.\
\
Typical code/text distinction. Elements, text, headers. Markdown is a
markup language like HTML.\
HTML is already preferable to MS Word because it is human-readable.\
\
MS Word tried to answer this criticism by making their rendering in XML.
Extensible markup language.\
XML was so exciting because it was able to make many different MLs.
'93It was like Aristotelian philosophy.'94\
\
HTML did not want to have control over the form of a paragraph, they
just wanted to have a semantic structure. They want to let the browser
worry about it. An HTML doc flows nicely between a large and small
screen. The formatting is not embedded there, just semantic elements.
The problem is that you'92re not going to write a term paper like that.\
\
Form, content, and formatting'97all are slightly different.\
(Style, content, and semantics)\
\
A purer version would be to have an element called emphasis and let
someone else decide if it was bold, italics, etc.\
\
Point of markdown was to create a '93not gunky'94 language (readable).
To answer to that Arisotelian ideal of content, semantics, and style.\
\
There is actually a governing body who decides what HTML is.\
Look up daring fireball. (Aaron Schwartz was involved.) A guy said '93I
propose this'94 and then markdown became very widely used.\
Reddit and Wiki comments are in markdown.\
