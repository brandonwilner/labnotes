\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Rehashing markdown \b0\
Personal data flows as vectors. Not only applicable for personal use.\
The same idea follows in literature.\
\
Various editing formats for blogging, MS Word, email, etc. They'92re
also all backed up differently.\
DT proposes unification. Use one format (plaintext) across these
platforms.\
One editing platform as well. One way to modify, back up, etc.\
There are political gains as well as advances in general convenience.\
There are large-scale societal impacts of this fragmentation.\
Once the environment is unified, you could use much more powerful tools
(e.g. one that tells you when you'92re overusing a word).\
Tools that grow with you'97change as your needs change.\
\
Plaintext as a format.\
Markdown (a plaintext format).\
\
 \b Using markdown \b0\
\
Download and use a local markdown program.\
The file is fine across all editers.\
Markdown is human readable; even when it'92s not typeset, it already
looks pretty good.\
Key idea is that you'92re not identifying stylistic elements, just
semantic ones.\
\
**emphasis** does make make something bold'97it only says that it should
be emphasized. Others can choose in what style to do so.\
\
\# heading\
\#\# subheading\
\#\#\# sub-sub-heading\
Title\
=======\
Title\
\
[link] (url)\
between two `everything is code.\ between three` is a code block.\
\
Ex:\
`\ # header\`\
\
Semantic, meaningful units of text.\
\
Two spaces is a line break (like </br>). Carriage return\
\> is the convention for a quotation.\
\
A renderer can put the text in MLA or Chicago \i later \i0 .\
\
Markdown source code can be written in any editor, but it has to be
saved in a plaintext editor.\
\
Vim, emex, sublime'97other editors. Nano is very simple. Dillinger is
just nice looking. Macdown is an edtior \b and \b0 a renderer.\
\
DT is happy to receive papers in markdown.\
Many boxes where you have to type text online already understand
markdown. For instance, stackexchange.com understands markdown. They
could have given a toolbox, but they just leave it to markdown.\
\
There is a tool from a philosophy prof at Berkeley. That'92s pandoc. It
converts anything into anything. A universal renderer. It works on a
command.\
Pick one that grows with you. When you'92re done writing, you'92ll
typeset.\
Authoria.\
\
Sometimes you might draft in markdown but you have to submit a Word
doc.\
\
You can connect plaintext to .bib (the way to save a bibliography).\
\
Yaml:\
three hyphens\
title:\
bibliography: bib.bib\
author:\
category: paper, academic\
three hyphens\
This is the place to put metadata.\
\
You don'92t need to indent; it'92s a formatting question, not a semantic
one.\
\
pandoc -so\
s '93be smart about the formatting.\
o is '93guess the type of file based on the extension'94 (.md)\
pandoc -so test.pdf test.md\
\
A command line tool is just a very simple application.\
These tools do one thing well. They all have the same syntax. The flags
are always flags. They'92re different, but they'92ll always be flags.\
