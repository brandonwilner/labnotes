### Unix

##### *To view our computing systems as literary ones*â€”thesis of the course

###### These are the basics of the terminal

    **GPS** (where am I?)

    pwd         
    ls
    tab
    cat (lists contents of the file)
    man
    echo  (echos what you put in)
    -h
    --h
    history

    **Files**
    mkdir (make a directory)
    touch (create file)
    cd   (change directory)
    cp  (copy file)(danger)
    mv  (view file)(danger)
    rm  (remove file)(danger)

    **Operators**
    >  (danger)  >>
    | (paginator)
    !

    **Paths/Shortcuts**
    / root
    ~ home
    - previous

    **Posix**
        v          adv            n
       rm          -i            temp
    "command"     "flag"         "target"

    **Search**
    find 
    awk
    grep  (search Ex: history | grep "hello")

    **Network**
    SCP
    SSM
    Ping
    Traceroute 
    rsync
    wget

"Tab the world." No spaces in filenames. Can mess up syntax. Also don't
use capitals. Be consistent in naming files.

To be safe, never use the "rm" function. Make a trash directory.

    mkdir temp/
    cd temp/
    Press "q" to exit scrolling through history.

    mkdir temp2/
    pwd
    ls
    cd temp2/
    pwd
    cd ..
    cd temp2
    touch target1.txt
    ls
    cp target1.twt target3.txt (makes copy of target one and titles it target3)

    A backslash indicates a directory "temp/"
    ls -l (list in longform)

\`\`\` Make sure you know where you are when you're doing these things.
Don't just press buttons.

Next time we'll be able to grab files from the net and stuff it into the
"same pipes."
