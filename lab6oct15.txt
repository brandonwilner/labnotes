    Unix split into two families: FreedBSD, Linux

    Find command
    . functions as "here"
    find . -name "ora*"
    / would search in the root directory
    * means "start with anything"

    Find functions similarly to Spotlight on Mac
    You can make the find function very complex, but it can also just be a general text search. 

    wget
    grep is like full-text search in a specific file.

    (save within nano command)
    (nano can add text to a file)
    cntl o
    enter
    cntl x

    grep syntax: look for orange   in whichever directory

    grep is recursive. can search every directory within a directory.

    grep "word" (file) | wc
    this command does word count:
    counts lines, (within however many) words, characters

    history | wc
    takes everything from history and passes it through wordcount

    We've just used tiny commands until now, but now we're doing text analysis

    sort oranges.txt | uniq -c
    sorts text alphabetically in unique line appearances.

Operating system has a difference b/t plaintext and binary. System has a
preference for plaintext.

At the bottom of it, a letter is expressed in the digital "gates" of a
computer.

    sed command - streamline editor
    sex 's/day/night' 24hrs.txt

"critical computing in the humanities"

    you can save these commands and turn them into shell scripts, like something that says "find every instance of "whale" with "pumpkin"

\`\`\` Assignment Analyze the treatment of gender in Moby Dick

Create a new project directory Grab the text of Moby Dick Make two lists
of gender words (files called male.txt and female.txt with he, male, him
and she, her)

Grab the context of all the male words and their contexts and with all
of the female words and their contexts. Get rid of common English words.

Second channel called "Weasel words" Take a piece of writing and check
for clarity of writing.

Copy three pieces of your own writing, convert them into plaintext, make
a list of files that are weasel words (clearly, obviously, words that
you hate in writing). Write a script that replaces those (only *three*)
weasel words with a space.

grep "pumpkin"

sed can take a file as an attribute. you can actually give it a list of
words.

grep -f obtains patterns from a file.
