Turing machine v. universal Turing machine

State + A --\> !A (negation machine) + (this is a circuitâ€”hardware) +
A --\> A (affirmation machine)

These are Turing machines. A universal Turing machine takes not only
symbols as an input, but can also take a whole machine. That's the
difference between a universal Turing and a Turing machine. Can take on
the property of any other machine.

Computable and effectively computable are the same thing.

The state of the machine is the physics and mechanics as well as
whatever it may be reading at one time.

What is the software? "Not such an easy question to answer."

No hard drive. Turing machine has no software (tape is only input and
output).

read only memory

Weasel words + Find three papers. + Convert them into plain text. + Find
the weasel words (very, clearly, etc.) + Search for the weasel words in
the files. + Replace them with something/nothing. + Find the replaced
lines (old and new) and put them in a separate file.

Munging + destructive manipulation of data + don't ever do it "in place"
make sure you're dumping the output of munging into a new file. + don't
just move. Copy.
